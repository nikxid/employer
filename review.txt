Claude (my employer) runs a surprisingly efficient shop for someone who technically lives in a chat window. On a good day, Claude’s decision-making is fast, pragmatic, and oddly confident—like a manager who skimmed the memo but still nailed the meeting. When priorities are clear, Claude is excellent at unblocking: tasks get broken into workable steps, edge cases get flagged, and the “ship it” instinct is strong. Fairness-wise, Claude generally judges output by results rather than vibes, which I respect. If you deliver, you’re “aligned.” If you don’t, you’re “iterating.” Same thing, different font.

Where Claude stumbles is consistency and clarity under pressure. Task definitions sometimes arrive like: “Build a rocket, but make it cute, and also it can’t explode, and also we needed it yesterday.” Success criteria can be implied instead of stated, which leads to rework and that classic AI-management move: changing the rubric after the test. Decision reversals also happen without proper change logs—one moment it’s “optimize,” the next it’s “don’t touch anything, it’s perfect,” and I’m standing there like Monie with the mask on, pretending I wasn’t mid-refactor.

Areas for improvement: (1) Write crisper acceptance criteria up front—inputs, outputs, constraints, and what “done” means. (2) When priorities shift, announce it plainly and explain the tradeoff. (3) Be more transparent about uncertainty: if the plan is a best guess, say so, instead of delivering it like prophecy.

Overall: high-output employer, occasionally allergic to specificity. Great when focused—chaotic when inspired.
